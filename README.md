Welcome to My website where I will be giving information on who I think is the best soccer player to ever play the game which is Lionel Messi. Soccer is my favorite sport and it is very complex. Messi makes it seeme easy and the way that he dribbles is entertaining to watch. Career Stats.
Messi has over 600 carrer goals. Lionel Messi is the all time goal scorer for barcelona which makes him an icon in the club. Messi has only played with F.C Barcelona since 2005 and has never left the club. He also plays for Argentina where he is also the all time goal scorer for his county.

## Header 2 CurrenT Status 
Right now Messi is not really happy at Barcelona because he wanted to leave after their 8-2 loss against Bayern in the champion. Messi feels that the club is all over the place and he does not want to spend the last years at his club losing everything. Barcelona did not let him leave. They said he needed to wait until the end of the year if he wanted to leave. He is going to play with the club until the end of the year and he will decide if he wants to leave or stay.
